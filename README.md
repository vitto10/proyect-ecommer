## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](http://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds the source code for CodeIgniter 4 only.
Version 4 is a complete rewrite to bring the quality and the code into a more modern version,
while still keeping as many of the things intact that has made people love the framework over the years.

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [the announcement](http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-62615.html) on the forums.

### Documentation

The [User Guide](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/) is the primary documentation for CodeIgniter 4.

The current **in-progress** User Guide can be found [here](https://codeigniter4.github.io/CodeIgniter4/).
As with the rest of the framework, it is a work in progress, and will see changes over time to structure, explanations, etc.

You might also be interested in the [API documentation](https://codeigniter4.github.io/api/) for the framework components.
